# Hillary Clinton is _____ But I'm Voting for Her Anyway

Like you, I find the prospect of voting for Hillary Clinton somewhat depressing. She seems to be a poor communicator, often reading (to me) as insincere or opportunistic, and I am uncomfortable with a number of her policy positions, particularly with regards to trade and foreign policy. 

I'm further discouraged by the elitist and sometimes condescending tone of her campaign, and by the tendency for her supporters and surrogates to ascribe reservations about her candidacy to a sexist aversion to a female president.

However, I'm also aware of the stakes in this election, and so I am absolutely voting for Hillary Clinton in spite of these feelings. I created this website in an attempt to convince you to do the same. 

My argument will come in four parts. First and most obvious given the name of this site, I'll explain how I overcame my reservations, and make the positive case for voting for Clinton in light of my conerns. Secondly, I will make the case for being engaged in this political cycle rather than getting bummed and dropping out. Thirdly, I will explain why this is not a good time to vote for a third party. Last but not least I will remind everyone what's at stake in this election; if all else has failed, I hope that will spur you to action.

The case I make may or may not resonate with you, but if it does, I urge you to do more than vote, to actively encourage or organize your friends, family, neighbors and co-workers to engage as well. If we believe our politics matter and that elections have consequences — and if you're reading this and I wrote this, I think we can assume we do — we must remember that voting is not the ultimate political act in a democracy. If we care about the outcome this cycle, voting is the least we can do.
