# How I Overcame my Resistance to Voting Clinton

I am not drawn to Hillary Clinton as a candidate. I didn't support her in 2008, and I didn't cast my primary vote for her this year either. However, I've overcome my reservations about her and will be voting for her in November. In this short essay, I'll explain my thinking, starting with how I found pease with my negative feelings, and then some reasons to actually be optimistic.

## Part 1 - Reasons to be Depressed and How I Got Past Them

### Her Hawkish Foreign Policy

The most significant problem I have with Hillary Clinton is [her hawkish military instincts](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/24/magazine/how-hillary-clinton-became-a-hawk.html?_r=0). Beginning with her vote for the war in Iraq, proceeding through the way she campaigned in 2008, and continuing during her tenure as Secretary of State, she exhibits a comfortability with unleashing violence, a believe in American hegemony, and a skepticism towards peacemaking and international cooperation. 

Putting it in the harshest terms, her political legacy includes getting a lot of people killed, and she seems to see this as a selling point. She is proud to be buddies with Henry Kissinger for crying out loud. 

However, politics is not about purity, and a vote is a moral endorsement. Elections are processes for choosing, and when it comes to choosing a President probably the single most important aspect is how they'll command the military. Given our choices in this election, Hillary is clearly the person I prefer to be in charge for the next four years. It's not really a contest.

### Neoliberal on Trade & Economic Inequality

This is the other huge policy issue I have with Clinton: she's a textbook neoliberal when it comes to the matters of trade and finance. Her history is one of supporting free trade deals (including the TPP until recently), and broadly championing the economic transformation over the past 30 years which has led to record inequality. 

Now, I actually don't believe for a second that she's "owned" by the big banks, but I do belive that she's ideologically their ally, living inside their filter bubble. This is why she can pull down big paychecks speaking to big Wall Street firms: basically she sees them as her peers.

However, when it comes to a number of her specific economic proposals, they're pretty good, if a bit incremental. She aims to raise the minimum wage, decrease student debt, end the shame of the US being the only industrialized country which doesn't mandate paid maternal leave. These are decent things to do.

In many ways she's not really all that different from Obama when it comes to economics. While her instincts lean towards continuing the process of creating a global elite, she's demonstrated herself as being responsive to political pressure on this point. 

To close out on this point, I also feel a need to stick up for the general idea of globalism and trade. While I don't think we've been doing a terrific job of handling economic globalization, I also don't believe there's really a real way to "go back" on the process. The future is not in national isolation; it's in figuring out a more broadly prosperous and humane way to integrate.

### She's a Pandering Career Politician

It's natural and perhaps even laudable for a politician to change their position when new evidence comes to light, or over a long enough time they simply change their mind. However, many of Hillary's reversals over her long career seem to be conspicuously associated with political expediency as opposed to finding new information or having a legitimate change of heart. 

This is frustrating, because it doesn't give one much of a sense of what she truly believes in. However, as I alluded to above, this is also something of an opportunity. It demonstrates that Clinton is responsive to political pressure and popular opinion around the issues.

When you say it like that, it's kind of par for the course. While you don't want a president whose whole agenda is poll-driven, being responsive to public sentiment is an element of the job description.

My sense is that while she won't push the envelope for progress she'll go as far as she feels it's safe, and hold the ground that's gained. She wasn't about to be a champion for marriage equality, but once there was some momentum there she was enthusiastically on board. Likewise, while she might be naturally inclined towards a hawkishly neoliberal outlook, she can be deterred by political reality (e.g. her about-face on the TPP).

### Bad at Campaigning

Hillary Clinton is by her own admission not a good campaigner. She's not a very good public speaker, which is hard not to notice compared to the incumbent Obama, or her primary opponent Bernie Sanders. 

A stark example of weakness was during the primary debates whenever they got to [the closing remarks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpTSYFf2YRQ). Sanders give a rehearsed but personable homily, starting with his growing up poor, pivoting to the issue of inequality, and finally eloquently presenting the mission of his campaign. In response, Clinton would basically run through a checklist. It was cringy, and impossible not to notice the different levels of audience response.

As someone who spent their early career practicing law, and their mid-life to late adulthood under harsh and adversarial scruitiny, Hillary Clinton is highly guarded and deliberate in what she says. She's risk-averse. She sticks to the script. The script is written from within her campaign's bubble and sometimes isn't super great. And again, she's not a natural orator. 

Similar to her shifting positions, I think this is actually about average as politicians go. It's more annoying than a reason to oppose her, but I list it here because if I'm being honest, it has contributed to my sense of depression. Ideally I want a candidate who inspires me, which she does not. 

That said, I do think that we're not used to seeing this relatively common combination of traits — some opportunitic shifts in position, a stiff and scripted talking-points communication style — show up in female form, which might explain some of why this sticks out so much. This is "typical politician" stuff, which isn't super awesome, but feels like it should be easier to get past than it seems to be.

But when you do get past it, this weakness is also a call to action. Let's be honest, Clinton the candidate needs help, and what she needs help with the most is communication. There's a natural place for you to fit in and help out here by making the case for Hillary in your own language to your own people. You'll do a better job than she will, and the world will thank you for your service.
